    <h2>Posthaste: Why the 'ABC' of tech is the place to be in 2022</h2>

      <p>Good morning!

        Apple Inc. recently breached the US$3 trillion market-cap barrier before easing back slightly, but the stock remains destined for loftier heights.
        
        Microsoft Corp. Amazon.com, Tesla and Alphabet Inc., which are part of the Big Tech oligopoly that are dominating the industry, have also rewarded investors with strong rallies and now account for a staggering 23 per cent of the S&P 500 index.
        
        Can they repeat their performance of the past few years, or should investors be looking for hidden gems elsewhere?
        
        “While this heavy weighting means these stocks will have a big impact on overall index returns, we no longer see them as the best place to look for outsized returns in the tech sector,” wrote Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at Global Wealth Management at UBS AG. “We expect more value to come from artificial intelligence, big data, and cybersecurity—the ABCs of tech.”
        
        UBS expects the theme to generate 10 per cent revenue growth over 2020–25 on average — higher than our estimate for the broader tech sector during this period (mid- to high-single-digit growth per year) — and earnings per share growth of 16 per cent per year on average.
        
        Artificial intelligence is expected to grow at 20 per cent a year to US$90 billion by 2025, suggesting a 2.5 times expansion over the next five years.
        
        Meanwhile, the global data universe is expect to surge by a factor of 10 from 2020 to 2030, “reaching 660 zettabytes — equivalent to 610 iPhones of 128GB capacity per person on the planet,” according to the UBS analyst.
        
        The rise in internet adoption in highly-populated Asian markets such as China, India, and Indonesia, and a proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) connected devices, will drive the sector’s growth.
        
        Finally, the dark side of the internet, cybercrime, is a growing danger as we increasingly live our lives virtually.
        
        A new NortonLifeLock reports shows that nearly 330 million people across 10 countries were victims of cybercrime and more than 55 million people were victims of identity theft last year. That’s a problem that will worsen as use of data and devices explode in the coming years.
        
        “Our “ABCs of tech” theme is driven by powerful secular trends around automation, analytics, and security — key strategic focus areas for many businesses,” Haefele wrote.

    <h2>SEC charges three in alleged insider trading scheme tied to proposed Aphria takeover, other deals</h2>
    <div class="right">
      <div> 
        <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1504607798333-52a30db54a5d?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxzZWFyY2h8NDl8fGZpbmFuY2V8ZW58MHx8MHx8&auto=format&fit=crop&w=700&q=60"> 
      </div>         
      <p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has charged three Florida men in a multi-million-dollar insider trading scheme related to three transactions — including a proposed takeover of Canadian cannabis business Aphria Inc.

        In a complaint filed Thursday, the U.S. regulator alleged David Schottenstein, 38, of Surfside, Fla., traded on material, non-public information obtained from a cousin who served on the board of directors of Green Growth Brands, the company that tried to buy Aphria in 2019. That transaction did not come to fruition.
        
        In a separate filing, the U.S. Department of Justice said Schottenstein has agreed to plead guilty to a single count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud in connection with the trading, from which the SEC alleges he made US$600,000 in “illicit gains.”
        
        In its complaint, the SEC alleged Schottenstein, who founded a designer sunglasses business in 2016 and whose family has longstanding connections in the U.S. retail sector, also tipped two close friends, Kris Bortnovsky and Ryan Shapiro, about the insider information he obtained ahead of public announcements.
        
        They are alleged to have made trades ahead of earnings reported by retailer DSW in the summer of 2017; an announced merger between Rite Aid and Albertsons Companies Inc. in 2018, which was later called off; and the hostile bid for Aphria.
        
        The U.S. regulator alleged Bortnovsky, who managed investment vehicles in which Schottenstein had invested, placed illicit trades for his investment management firm Sakal Capital Management, LLC and one of its hedge funds, Sakal U.S. Fund, LLC, in addition to trading in individual brokerage accounts owned by himself and another person.
        
        According to the SEC complaint, Bortnovsky used these various accounts to trade ahead of all three announcements for total profits of more than US$4 million. Shapiro allegedly traded Rite Aid and Aphria and reaped total profits of approximately US$121,000.
        
        None of the allegations have been proven. 
        
        David Schottenstein’s cousin, who is referred to only as Insider 1 in the SEC complaint, served on the board of directors of both Green Growth Brands and DSW, according to the document. The Schottenstein family owned a private business that was involved in the Rite Aid transaction, according to the filing, which refers to the cousin’s father as Insider 2.
        
        Though neither relative is named, their descriptions match Joey and Jay Schottenstein. A spokesperson for the two men told Reuters they were “shocked and saddened” to learn of the alleged illegal conduct.

        <h2>WhatsApp co-founder Acton named Signal's interim CEO</h2>
        <div class="left">

            <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1621264448270-9ef00e88a935?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxzZWFyY2h8NjB8fGZpbmFuY2V8ZW58MHx8MHx8&auto=format&fit=crop&w=700&q=60"> 
          </div>         
          <p>Marlinspike will step down and WhatsApp co-founder Brian Acton will become the interim CEO, Marlinspike said in a blog post on Monday.

            "It's a new year, and I've decided it's a good time to replace myself as the CEO of Signal", he said. Marlinspike, who will remain on Signal's board, said he is scouting for candidates for the permanent CEO position.
            
            Acton founded Signal's rival messaging app WhatsApp in 2009. The company was bought by Meta Platforms, then Facebook Inc, in 2014. He left WhatsApp in 2017 due to differences around the use of customer data and targeted advertising, according to Signal's website.
            
            In February 2018, he alongside Marlinspike, started the non-profit Signal Foundation, which currently oversees the app, by providing an initial funding of $50 million.
            
            Signal, an end-to-end encrypted messaging platform, has been endorsed by people including Twitter Inc co-founder Jack Dorsey, and whistleblower and privacy advocate Edward Snowden.
